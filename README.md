## The Problem:

How many times did you buy a clothing item online, got really excited and then got super disappointed when it arrived, and it didn't fit as well as you imagined?

Unfortunately - Online clothes shopping can be tricky because you can't try things on before they arrive, which can lead to disappointment if the fit or style isn't what you expected.


## The Solution:

E-commerce websites can be equipped with virtual dressing rooms that allow users to try on multiple clothes virtually and select the best-looking outfit.

It's never been easier to look fabulous!!!


## The Approach:

I created a Virtual clothing assistant using Deep learning algorithms in order to help the costumers.

The user can select the clothing item he/she wants to wear and then upload his/her image of any pose they want, and the assistant will help to dress that human with his/her selected clothing item.


*So how exactly does it work?*
1.  	Input - We allow the user to upload his/her image and their clothing itemâ€™s image.

2.  	Cloth mask - We create a cloth mask with U2Net.

3.  	Body position - We get a body position estimation and key points with Mediapipe.

4.  	Body parsing - We parse the user body with Self-Correction-Human-Parsing.

5.     Body segmentation - We segment the user body with SegGenerator.
  
6.     Generating the result - ALIASGenerator uses these to create the requested image.(unfinished)
  
7.     Output - a new image of the user wearing the requested item. (unfinished)

## Explanation about U2NET

A neural network architecture which is designed for image segmentation tasks.

A brief explanation of my code:

â€¢	*REBNCONV class:* This is a basic building block of the network, consisting of a convolutional layer followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.

â€¢	*RSU (Recursive Supervision Unit) classes:* These classes define the network architecture, with each RSU containing multiple REBNCONV blocks. RSU7, RSU6, RSU5, RSU4, and RSU4F represent different levels of the network hierarchy, gradually reducing spatial dimensions while increasing feature channels.

â€¢	*U2NET class:* This is the main U2Net architecture, composed of multiple RSU stages for feature extraction and a decoder section for feature expansion. It takes an input image and produces multiple side outputs at different scales, which are then concatenated and passed through a final convolutional layer to produce the segmentation mask.

â€¢	*U2NETP class:* This is a smaller variant of UÂ²-Net, designed for faster inference with lower computational resources. It follows a similar architecture but with fewer parameters and lower-resolution feature maps.

The code also includes operations for upsampling (_upsample_like) and side-output convolution layers (side1 through side6) to generate the final segmentation map.

Overall, U2Net and U2NetP are deep neural networks for semantic segmentation tasks, with U2Net being more complex and suitable for higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational requirements, while U2NetP is a smaller and faster variant designed for real-time or resource-constrained applications.

## Explanation about Mediapipe

Mediapipe is a versatile framework developed by Google that provides tools for building various computer vision and machine learning applications, including pose estimation. My code uses the Mediapipe library to perform pose estimation on the model image, saves the detected pose landmarks, and creates an annotated image for visualization.

## Explanation about SegGenerator

Semantic segmentation pipeline designed for human parsing. Its primary function is to process input data and produce a detailed segmentation map that identifies various human body parts and clothing items.

A brief explanation of my code:

â€¢	*Network Architecture:* The segmentation generator consists of several convolutional layers (conv1 to conv9) interleaved with normalization and activation functions. Each convolutional layer extracts and refines features from the input image. Max-pooling and upsampling layers are used to control the spatial resolution of feature maps. The generator's architecture progressively reduces spatial dimensions and then increases them to produce the final segmentation map. The final layer applies the sigmoid activation function to map the network's output to the range [0,1].

â€¢	*Forward Pass:* The forward method defines the forward pass of the generator. It takes the input image x and passes it through the network layers. Each convolutional layer is followed by an activation function (ReLU) and normalization. Max-pooling and upsampling layers are used to adjust the spatial resolution of feature maps at different stages. The final output is obtained after applying the sigmoid activation to produce the segmentation map.

## Explanation about ALIASGenerator

The main generator network for image synthesis. a crucial component of an image generation system that takes into account segmentation information to produce images with specific attributes and characteristics. It involves normalization, conditioning, and upsampling to generate high-quality output images.

A brief explanation of my code:

â€¢	*ALIASNorm*: This is a module that performs normalization and conditioning on image data. It supports parameter-free normalization types such as batch, instance, and custom "mask" normalization. The module applies normalization to input data, taking into account segmentation information. It also incorporates noise into the input data. Affine parameters (gamma and beta) are produced based on the segmentation map and applied to the normalized input.

â€¢	*ALIASResBlock*: defines a residual block used in the ALIAS generator. It contains convolutional layers and normalization operations. Residual connections are used to improve gradient flow during training. Segmentation information and misalignment masks are considered during normalization.

â€¢	*ALIASGenerator*: This is the core generator module for generating images. It comprises multiple components, including convolutional layers and residual blocks. The generator takes input data, segmentation maps, segmentation diversity maps, and misalignment masks. It progressively upsamples and refines the input data to produce an output image. The generator architecture is flexible, with the number of upsampling layers determined by the specified configuration.
